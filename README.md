In this application I dive deep in Networking. The app is built on the UICollectionView basis and UIStoryboard. I learned how to obtain data from the Internet and show it on the screen. 
The technologies which I was working with are:

API
Facebook SDK
Google SDK
Firebase
Cocoapods

I've learned how to make logging in and out using such platforms as GoogleSignIn, FBSDKLoginKit and then I saved the user's data on Firebase using FirebaseAuth.
